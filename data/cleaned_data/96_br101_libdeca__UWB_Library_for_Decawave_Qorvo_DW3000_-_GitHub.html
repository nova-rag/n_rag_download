This is a library with convenient functions and abstractions on top of the API provided by decadriver and dwt_uwb_driver.
It is tailored to be used with dw3000-decadriver-source, but it can also be used with the binary-only library dwt_uwb_driver from Qorvo.
It provides:
Simplified initialization functions
Deferred IRQ handling for the NRF-SDK and ESP-IDF platforms
Functions for getting recommended PHY parameters
A convenint API for defining TX buffer properties
Helpers for converting time units
A simple to use implementation of two-way ranging (TWR)
Some definitions for IEEE 802.15.4 frame formats
Blink and Sync messages
Most of the code is pure platform-independent C code, and can be used anywhere, but IRQ handling is platform specific and implemented for:
Zephyr (version 3.6, NRF Connect SDK v2.7.0)
ESP-IDF (version 5.1.1)
NRF SDK (version 17.1.0)
Zephyr
Add this to the main CMakeLists.txt:
list(APPEND ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/libdeca/platform)
ESP-IDF
For ESP-IDF it can be used by adding it to the components directory.
NRF-SDK v17.1.0
Just add the necessary files to your Makefile or IDE. Define the log functions in log.h
Usage for TWR
Here is an example for initializing the library and using it for TWR:
#include "dw3000_hw.h"
#include "dwhw.h"
#include "dwmac.h"
#include "dwphy.h"
#include "dwproto.h"
static void twr_done_cb(uint64_t src, uint64_t dst, uint16_t dist,
uint16_t num)
{
LOG_INF("TWR Done %04X: %d cm", (uint16_t)dst, dist);
}
void test_twr(void)
{
// decadriver init
dw3000_hw_init();
dw3000_hw_reset();
dw3000_hw_init_interrupt();
// libdeca init
dwhw_init();
dwphy_config();
dwphy_set_antenna_delay(DWPHY_ANTENNA_DELAY);
dwmac_init(PANID, MAC16, dwprot_rx_handler, NULL, NULL);
dwmac_set_frame_filter();
twr_init(TWR_PROCESSING_DELAY);
twr_set_observer(twr_done_cb);
// two way ranging to 0x0001
twr_start(0x0001);
}
The other side is initialized the same, but instead of twr_start() has to enable receive mode:
dwmac_set_rx_reenable(true);
dwt_forcetrxoff();
dwt_rxenable(DWT_START_RX_IMMEDIATE);
If you get error messages like this:
E (4983) DECA: TX error seq 0 (0x4080e1a0)
E (4983) DECA:
SYS Time:
442f907a00
E (4993) DECA:
TX Time:
442ea48234
E (4993) DECA:
Diff:
ff140834 (-242 us)
then the interrupt processing on your CPU is not fast enough (in this case we wanted to transmit a packet at a certain time but we were 242us too late). You can increase TWR_PROCESSING_TIME in ranging.h, or pass a different number to twr_init() but they have to be the same on both sides (transmit and receive). For more exact distance measurements it's better to have a lower number here. Also note that logging, especially in interrupt context in dwmac_irq.c can have an impact on the processing time, so after you are sure you get the right interrupts, it's better to disable logging there.
