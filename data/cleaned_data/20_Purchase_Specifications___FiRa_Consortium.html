A primary objective of the FiRa Consortium is to support the increased use of UWB technology across a wide variety of use cases and applications. To support this objective, our member companies work tirelessly on the development of Technical Specifications and Test Specifications, ultimately designed to create an interoperable, holistic, and inter-connected ecosystem.As a part of membership, FiRa Consortium member companies have access to these Specifications at no extra cost. By joining FiRa, organizations may participate in the development of use cases and specifications, help define parameters of the certification program, influence regulatory decision-making, and communicate to the market about UWB technology.For organizations who wish to access the Specifications without joining FiRa, each Specification can be purchased for a nominal fee.The following information is applicable:Specifications are provided as PDF documents.Specifications are available for “individual use” at $200 per Specification or for “enterprise use” at $600 per Specification. (The “enterprise” version may be used by multiple individuals within the organization.) Please note that orders in the US will be subject to applicable sales taxes.There will be a processing fee of $25 per order. If multiple Specifications are ordered at the same time, there will be a single $25 processing fee.Should you have questions about the purchase of these Specifications, please contact FiRa Consortium.

FiRa® Physical Layer (PHY) Technical Specification v2.0.0 This document specifies the FiRa® Physical (PHY) layer requirements for the UWB Subsystem (UWBS).  The PHY technical requirements in this document are extensions to the IEEE Std 802.15.4-2020 and IEEE Std 802.15.4z-2020 Specifications designed to support a variety of FiRa use cases and marketing requirements.
FiRa® Medium Access Control (MAC) Technical Specification v2.0.0 This document specifies the FiRa® Medium Access Control (MAC) layer requirements for the UWB Subsystem (UWBS).  The MAC technical requirements in this document are extensions to the IEEE Std 802.15.4-2020 and IEEE Std 802.15.4z-2020 Specifications designed to support a variety of FiRa use cases and marketing requirements.
FiRa® UWB Command Interface (UCI) Technical Specification v2.0.0 This document specifies the communication protocol between the UWB Subsystem (UWBS) and the Host called the FiRa® UWB Subsystem Command Interface (UCI).  This protocol is used for general operations of the UWBS as well as for conformance and interoperability testing as part of the FiRa Certification Program.
FiRa® Common Service & Management Layer (CSML) Technical Specification v1.0.0 This document specifies the requirements for the FiRa® UWB host framework and application programming interfaces between other host components, a secure component, and FiRa-enabled applications.  This framework is often referred to as the Common Service & Management Layer (CSML).
FiRa® Secure UWB Service (SUS) API Technical Specification v1.0.0 This document specifies the requirements for the FiRa® Secure UWB Services Application Programming Interfaces (SUS API).  This includes defining external reference interfaces between a secure component and a UWBS and the internal interface between a service applet and the SUS applet.
FiRa® Bluetooth® Low Energy Out-of-Band (OOB) Channel Technical Specification v.1.0.0 This document specifies the use of Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE) to implement the Out-of-Band (OOB) Channel used by the FiRa® Framework.
FiRa® Java Card SUS Internal API Technical Specification v1.0.0 This Java code archive specifies the requirements for the FiRa® Java Card Secure UWB Services (SUS) Internal Application Programming Interface (API).
FiRa® Physical Access Control System (PACS) Profile Technical Specification v1.0.0 This document specifies the requirements for the FiRa® Physical Access Control System (PACS) Profile including the system architecture, high-level operational flows, configuration information and data model associated with a physical access control system.Test Specifications
FiRa® Physical Layer (PHY) Conformance Test Specification v2.0.0 This document specifies the FiRa® Physical (PHY) layer conformance tests used in the FiRa Certification Program to test conformance to the FiRa Physical Layer (PHY) Technical Specification.
FiRa® Medium Access Control (MAC) Conformance Test Specification v2.0.0 This document specifies the FiRa® Medium Access Control (MAC) layer conformance tests used in the FiRa Certification Program to test conformance to the FiRa Medium Access Control (MAC) Technical Specification.
FiRa® UWB Command Interface (UCI) Extension for Testing v2.0.0 This document specifies test communication protocol additions to the FiRa® UWB Command Interface (UCI) between the UWB Subsystem (UWBS) and the Host used for testing purposes.  This protocol is used to control test specific commands for conformance testing as part of the FiRa Certification Program.
FiRa® USB Virtual Communication (VCOM) Test Specification v2.0.0 This document specifies the Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection port interface between the FiRa® Test Platforms and the device under test used by the FiRa Certification Program.  The connection port interface is a virtual serial communication (VCOM) operating over a USB transport.
FiRa® Interoperability Test Specification v2.0.0 This document specifies the FiRa® interoperability tests used in the FiRa Certification Program to test the device under test with FiRa reference devices. Buy Now
