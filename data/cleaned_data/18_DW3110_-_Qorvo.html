Qorvo's DW3110 is part of the DW3000 family of second-generation, fully integrated Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband (UWB) wireless transceivers.
Based on the IEEE802.15.4z standard, the DW3110 implements enhanced security features.
DW3110 can achieve data rates of up to 6.8 Mbps while delivering precise positioning to within 10 cm for ranging and +/-5 degrees for angular measurement.
The DW3110 transceiver is interoperable with the Apple U1 & U2 chip.
The DW3110 is FiRa™ compliant and supports Two-Way Ranging, Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Phase Difference of Arrival (PDoA) implementations.
Optimized for low-power battery-operated operation, the DW3000 family of products is designed to be used in mobile, consumer, and industrial applications thanks to different small footprint package options and reduced external BOM.

Qorvo UWB Solutions Certified for Apple U1 Interoperability
July 20, 2022
DWM3000EVB Arduino Shield
Qorvo's DWM3000EVB is an Arduino form factor compatible shield designed for the evaluation of the DWM3000 ultra-wideband (UWB) module for use in a scalable real time location system (RTLS).
This Arduino shield can be used with the customer's choice of microcontroller. The Arduino shield form factor is supported by many MCU vendors including STMicroelectronics, Nordic Semiconductor and more.
The DWM3000EVB is designed to be compliant to the FiRa™ PHY and MAC specifications enabling interoperability with other FiRa™ compliant devices.
The DWM3000EVB is interoperable with the Apple U1 chip.
DWM3001CDK Development Kit
Qorvo's DWM3001CDK Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Transceiver Development Kit is a development kit that features the DWM3001C module. This kit can be used to evaluate hardware performance as a TWR or TDoA Tag and build an evaluation real time location system (RTLS).
Two micro USB ports connect to the J-Link and DWM3001C USB interface. An on-board J-Link debugger provides SWD and UART interfaces to the DWM3001C. Two micro USB ports connect to the J-Link and DWM3001C USB interface. The board can be powered from either of these USB ports, a Raspberry Pi interface, a battery or an external power supply.
The DWM3001CDK is interoperable with the Apple U1 chip.
QM33120WDK1 Development Kit
Qorvo's QM33120WDK1 consists of two different daughter boards (AoA and non-AoA) mounted on two Nordic nRF52840 DK evaluation boards. Application firmware development is facilitated by the features of the Nordic boards such as on-board J-Link debugger, USB and Bluetooth® Low Energy interfaces.
The QM33120WDK1 is designed to develop applications compatible with PHY and MAC FiRa™ specifications.
