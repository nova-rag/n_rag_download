Repository organisation
The following layout is used:
kernel: all the Linux specific code
kernel/drivers: the DW3000 driver
kernel/net/mcps802154: the Linux specific code for the mcps and symbolic
links to the general purpose MAC code
mac: the general purpose MAC layer code, to be used in various targets
including the Linux kernel
HOWTO
SETUP your target
⚠️ IMPORTANT Please note that the following section describes how to setup a build for the
db845c Dragonboard target and must be adapted to your own system.
Copy config/sdm845-db845c-uwb.dts in arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sdm845-db845c-uwb.dts to support dw3000 device in your Device Tree (DT)
Please note the following key points:
the SPI controller driver is now an external module named
spi-geni-qcom-lowlatency. (for DB)
the dw3000@0 is put inside the &spi2 node.
interrupts must be changed to match the GPIO where the dw3000 IRQ pin is
connected.
uwbhal,reset-gpio = <&tlmm 50 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW> must be change to match the
GPIO where the dw3000 reset pin is connected.
uwbhal,affinity must be set to the cpumask where to put our own threaded
softirq and SPI controller thread to achieve good performance.
dw3000_default_state must be change according required GPIO configuration.
compatible = "decawave,dw3000" is the module alias used by our SPI driver
so the ko is automatically loaded
Copy db845c-uwb_defconfig in arch/arm64/configs/db845c-uwb_defconfig
Once your target device tree is configured, create a new build.config to
include our requirements for the kernel configuration.
Like config/build.config.db845c
For example on the Dragonboard db845c's:
KERNEL_DIR=common
. ${ROOT_DIR}/common/build.config.common
. ${ROOT_DIR}/common/build.config.aarch64
DEFCONFIG=db845c-uwb_defconfig
MAKE_GOALS="${MAKE_GOALS}
qcom/sdm845-db845c-uwb.dtb
Image.gz
"
FILES="
arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz
arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sdm845-db845c-uwb.dtb
"
Ensure that you kernel is built with the following options:
Enable GPIOLIB support
CONFIG_GPIOLIB=y
Enable IEEEE802154 support
CONFIG_6LOWPAN=m
CONFIG_IEEE802154=m
CONFIG_IEEE802154_NL802154_EXPERIMENTAL=y
CONFIG_IEEE802154_6LOWPAN=m
CONFIG_MAC802154=m
BUILD
Overview
Qorvo UWB driver can be built as an external module using the
common-android-mainline kernel manifest.
It must be passed as prebuilt kernel to the AOSP build script to generate a boot
image ready to be flashed.
Build kernel and modules
If the uwb-release project is installed in <UWB_RELEASE_PATH>, run from your
kernel source build:
EXT_MODULES=${UWB_RELEASE_PATH}/kernel ./build/build.sh
For the dragonboard db845c, using the android 5.9 stable kernel,
out/android-mainline/dist/ contains the kernel and its modules.
Build images for the dragonboard db845c
Install the content of the previously built kernel folder into your device
kernel prebuilt location.
For the dragonboard db845c, using the android 5.9 stable kernel, prebuit kernel
is located in the target repository inside AOSP sources:
device/linaro/dragonboard-kernel/android-5.9
Enable Permissive SELinux
Our SELinux rules have not yet been written for this release,
for now enable the permissive mode:
In BoardConfig.mk:
BOARD_KERNEL_CMDLINE += androidboot.selinux=permissive
Add Qorvo vendor modules
Copy all the content of platform_vendor_qorvo in vendor/qorvo.
In your device.mk, add the vendor extension:
$(call inherit-product-if-exists, vendor/qorvo/device.mk)
Then recompile the AOSP sources.
⚠️ IMPORTANT Please ensure that the dw3000 module is loaded on startup
after the following dependencies:
spi-geni-qcom-lowlatency (or your board driver)
mac802154
mcps802154
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch db845c-userdebug
make
Testing
once you flashed yout android boards, you can launch a fira ranging with the following commands on the boards :
service call uwb 10 i32 0
haluwbctl start_fira_twr_session -a 1 -d 2
service call uwb 10 i32 0
haluwbctl start_fira_twr_session -a 1 -d 2 --responder --controlee
To find out more : haluwbctl --help
