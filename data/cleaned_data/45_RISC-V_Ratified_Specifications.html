Specification Stage Definitions
Development
Assume everything is subject to change. At this stage, ideas, structures, and content are still evolving. Feedback and iteration are encouraged as nothing is final, and adjustments may be frequent.
Stable
Changes may still occur, but they should be limited in scope. The core structure and content are mostly settled, with only refinements or necessary adjustments expected. Any modifications should be carefully considered to maintain stability.
Frozen
Changes are highly unlikely. A high threshold will be applied, and modifications will only be made in response to critical issues. Any other proposed changes should be addressed through a follow-on extension.
Ratified
No changes are allowed. Any necessary or desired modifications must be addressed through a follow-on extension. Ratified extensions are never revised.
