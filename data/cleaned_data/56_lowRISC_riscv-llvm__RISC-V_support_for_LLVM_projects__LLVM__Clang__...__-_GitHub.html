About
This repository hosts a series of patches implementing a RISC-V backend for
LLVM as well as initial tutorial material. For more information, see:
September RISC-V LLVM status
update
The most recent status update to the LLVM mailing
list
The lowRISC RISC-V LLVM status page
The initial
RFC for
more about the implementation approach being taken with this port.
Our intent is that development and code review primarily occurs upstream on
LLVM infrastructure. However, there is value is maintaining the RISC-V backend
implementation as a set of clean patches. These will be continually rebased
with the intention that they provide a useful reference for anybody starting a
new LLVM backend or who wants to better understand backend implementation.
Mini FAQ
Should I be compiling my code with Clang and the RISC-V LLVM backend?
If you simply want to compile your C/C++ codebase for RISC-V then for the time
being, just using GCC is a simpler starting point. Once RISC-V LLVM support is
included in an official LLVM release in the future and is made slightly more
user friendly, the answer to this question should change.
When should I use this repository and when should I use upstream LLVM/Clang
If you find the step-by-step patch history useful for educational purposes or
want to check if there are any patches that I'm preparing for upstream but
haven't submitted yet, then using this repository may be worthwhile. In all
other cases, and especially if you want to contribute to the effort you are
strongly advised to use the upstream LLVM
repositories.
How can I build upstream LLVM+Clang and use it to cross-compile for a riscv32 target?
First you will need a built RISC-V gcc toolchain. The linker, compiled
libraries, and libc header files will be used. You can build your own by
following the instructions at the riscv-gnu-toolchain
repo. It is sufficient to do
the following:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
./configure --prefix=/your/gccinstallpath --with-arch=rv32imc --with-abi=ilp32
make -j9
You can then check out upstream LLVM and Clang and build it. llvm.org has
useful documentation on building LLVM with
CMake, but you should find enough to get
started below. Note that you will need to apply a single out-of-tree patch for
riscv32-unknown-elf target support in Clang until
it is reviewed and committed.
git clone https://git.llvm.org/git/llvm.git
cd llvm/tools
git clone https://git.llvm.org/git/clang.git/
cd clang
wget https://reviews.llvm.org/D46822?download=true -O baremetal.patch
patch -p0 < baremetal.patch
cd ../../
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" \
-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=True -DLLVM_USE_SPLIT_DWARF=True \
-DLLVM_OPTIMIZED_TABLEGEN=True \
-DLLVM_BUILD_TESTS=True \
-DDEFAULT_SYSROOT="/path/to/riscv-gcc-install-path/riscv32-unknown-elf" \
-DGCC_INSTALL_PREFIX="/path/to/riscv-gcc-install-path" \
-DLLVM_DEFAULT_TARGET_TRIPLE="riscv32-unknown-elf" \
-DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="RISCV" ../
cmake --build .
./bin/clang /path/to/testfile.c
A few notes on the above CMake invocation and issues you might encounter:
It's possible to build LLVM with RISC-V support with a much simpler CMake
invocation. Ultimately you need to ensure you set
-DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="RISCV"
This produces a debug build of LLVM and Clang which is significantly more
useful for bug reporting if you encounter any issues. The downsides are that
it will execute more slowly and compilation requires a large amount of disk
space (~12G).
Building LLVM puts a heavy load on your linker. If you have lld installed,
you may find significantly less memory is required to link if you set
-DLLVM_ENABLE_LLD=True. Alternatively, ensure that /bin/ld is symlinked to
ld.gold rather than ld.bfd.
It isn't necessary to set the default sysroot, gcc install prefix and
default target triple when building clang, but doing so means you don't need
to pass these arguments explicitly when invoking it. If you prefer, you can
explicitly pass these flags when cross-compiling: -target riscv32-unknown-elf
--sysroot=/path/to/riscv-gcc-install-path/riscv32-unknown-elf
--gcc-toolchain=/path/to/riscv-gcc-install-path
You can also compile for riscv32-unknown-linux-elf in conjunction with a
multilib toolchain as produced by the scripts in the riscv-gnu-toolchain
repository. Note that only the
ilp32 ABI is supported for the moment.
Status
As of May 2018, the vast majority of these patches are now upstream and most
users wishing to experiment with support for RISC-V in LLVM projects will
likely be best served by building directly from the upstream repositories. You
may prefer to follow this repository if you want to study how the backend is
put together.
Note that the patches in this repository are over-due for another rebase. I
hope to address this soon.
The current patchset allows the entirety of the GCC torture suite to compile
and run for {RV32I, RV32IM, RV32IFD}. Additionally, all torture suite
tests compile and run for RV64I at O1, O2, O3, and Os. MC-layer support is
present for RV32IMAFDC+RV64IMAFDC, and codegen support for RV32IMFDC and
RV64I. See the lowRISC RISC-V LLVM status
page for more details.
Future plans
As well as the obvious implementation tasks, it is also our intent to augment
this patchset with copious documentation. The initial draft of this
documentation is available in this repository.
Our aim is that RISC-V is the cleanest and most documented LLVM backend. As
well as benefiting the wider LLVM community, this will make it substantially
easier for research groups and hobbyists to explore hardware/software
co-design with RISC-V.
Our lowRISC project is working to produce a
completely open source System-on-Chip implementing the RISC-V instruction set
architecture. One of the features we are pursuing is tagged
memory. This
repository will eventually host compiler support for that feature, although
this may need time to mature before being ready to upstream and so may be
developed in a separate branch.
RFCs
This work has so far produced a number of request for comment (RFC) threads on
the LLVM mailing list:

backends

How to build the patchset in this repository
There are two things to note:
This repository currently serves a dual purpose - providing a clean and
constantly rebased "perfect" history of the full RISC-V patchset, as well as
being a way to grab all patches in one go, including those that haven't yet
been committed upstream. As more and more patches are committed upstream, this
repository will become mainly interesting as a reference on how to implement
an LLVM backend, and aid in understanding the RISC-V backend. If you just want
to test out the latest RISC-V LLVM support, chekcing out and building upstream
LLVM is probably your best choice.
This LLVM and Clang work is not quite at a stage where end-users are likely
to find it useful. However, building and trying it out is a great first step
towards contributing to the development effort.
You might build LLVM and Clang with these patches applied by doing something
like the below. See the LLVM
documentation for more general
guidance. You will need ~7GiB space for a debug build of LLVM+Clang.
