The Qorvo® QM33120WDK1 is a development kit for the low power, low cost QM33110W and QM33120W UWB transceivers.
This kit can be used to evaluate the hardware performance of the devices in TWR, TDoA and AoA systems and can help to build an evaluation real time location system (RTLS). It also enables the development of applications based on DW3110, DW3120, DW3210, DW3220 UWB transceivers.
It includes two different daughter boards (AoA and non-AoA) mounted on two Nordic nRF52840 DK evaluation boards. Application firmware development is facilitated by the features of the Nordic boards such as on-board J-Link debugger, USB and Bluetooth® Low Energy interfaces.
The QM33120WDK1 is designed to develop applications compatible with PHY and MAC FiRa™ specifications.
Typical Applications
High precision real time location systems
Location-aware wireless sensor networks
Asset tracking
Factory / warehouse automation & security
Healthcare staff & patient location
Retail security, navigation & customer analytics
