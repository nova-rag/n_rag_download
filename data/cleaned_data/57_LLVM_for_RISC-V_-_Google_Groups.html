If you are interested in cross compilers for Linux using clang/llvm
you can use meta-clang with yocto/openembedded
https://github.com/kraj/meta-clang/blob/master/README.md
for riscv you would also add meta-riscv
https://github.com/riscv/meta-riscv/blob/master/README.md
if you want full in one go then use yoe distro
https://github.com/YoeDistro/yoe-distro/blob/master/README.md
. ./qemuriscv64-envsetup.sh
in conf/local.conf add
TOOLCHAIN ?= "clang"
CLANGSDK = "1"
to use clang as the compiler.
Thanks
