Version v7.2.0-3-20180506 is a maintenance release of GNU MCU Eclipse
RISC-V Embedded GCC; it updates to the latest RISC-V sources and the
build process was improved, to add gdb-py and to support even older
GNU/Linux machines and processors.

Compliance
All GNU MCU Eclipse RISC-V Embedded GCC releases are based on the
official RISC-V source files
maintained by SiFive.
By the date of this release, the riscv-gcc-7.3.0 branch is not yet
stable, thus the current version is still based on GCC 7.2, using the
following commits:
the riscv/riscv-gcc project,
branch riscv-gcc-7.2.0, commit
36e932c
from from Jan 16th, 2018
the riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb
project, branch riscv-binutils-2.29, commit
f60a065
from May 3rd, 2018
the riscv/riscv-newlib project,
commit 1e50b13
from Feb 27th, 2018
Improvements
All architectures, ABIs and libraries supported by the riscv64-unknown-elf
toolchain are also supported, with the following improvements:
a newer newlib was included, which supports the ‘underscore’ syscall functions
the mandatory reference to libgloss in the linker configuration was removed
the march=rv32imaf/mabi=ilp32f library was added to the list of multilibs
support for newlib-nano was added
the standard documentation, in PDF and HTML, was added
Binaries
Binaries for Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux are provided.
The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bit),
and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.
The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably
recent i686 and x86_64 Windows machines.
Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the
How to install the RISC-V toolchain?
page.
The toolchain is also available as an
xPack
and can be conveniently installed with
xpm:
$ xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc
This installs the latest available version.
For better control and repeatability, the build scripts use Docker
containers; all files required during builds are available as a separate
gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc-build
project.
Known problems
due to a missing option in the build script, the libraries are not
functional for 64-bit devices, the build fails (fixed in 7.2.0-4):
locale.c:(.text.__locale_ctype_ptr+0x8): relocation truncated to fit: R_RISCV_HI20 against `.LANCHOR0'
the libnosys library does not export the correct underscore symbols.
