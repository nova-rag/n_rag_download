Reviews
Mar 2024
Well-paced set of questions, randomly arranged. They are not 'trick' or 'mensa-like' questions, thus little need for memorization. With a strong solid knowledge of the basics, I found it very straightforward to brain out the correct answer among all the choices given. A TON of thought was put into this question & answer pool, it is clear.
Dec 2023
Extremely well thought out questions that need an in-depth understanding of RISC-V internals.
Nov 2023
The questions are very thought out and require expert understanding of the topic.
Sep 2023
I studied a lot for this exam and it was really challenging. I loved the idea of proctor, this brings value to this certification exam, otherwise most certifications are not so reliable. If I see someone having an RVFA certification, I will certainly be sure that this person has extensive knowledge about RISC-V.
