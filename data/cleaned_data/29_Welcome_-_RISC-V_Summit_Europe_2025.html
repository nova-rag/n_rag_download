Sovereignty, independence, innovation: 7 years of HW/SW codesign with RISC-V at CEA
T1.1.05, Tuesday 13 at 10:00, in Gaston Berger amphitheater (S2).
By Thomas Dombek, Head of Digital Integrated Circuits and Systems Department, CEA.
Abstract: By ending the epoch of closed, proprietary ISAs, RISC-V has opened a new era of innovation in the computing world. Its open ISA not only enables the tailoring of architecture to various application domains, from performance to low power, and from safety to security, but it also enables new forms of joint initiatives in the design and tools ecosystem. This ranges from new forums of cooperation between industrial competitors in the market, to new models of industry/academic collaboration. The versatility of open ISA specifications, which enables both open-source, public cooperation and also closed-door commercial agreements, will facilitate new kinds of partnerships and unexpected advances in the computing field at large. This talk will provide a return of experience from seven years of commitment to the RISC-V ecosystem and, a peek at key achievements of CEA and its academic and business partners.

By Mat O’Donnell, Software Architect Lead, Siemens.
Abstract: A modern RISC-V SoC may have up to several thousand embedded processor cores, running highly optimized software workloads in the field. Time-to-market pressures, system performance and in-field reliability requirements drive a need for high visibility into large fleets of deployed devices executing real-life software workloads. Traditional debug solutions are typically not built for the complexity seen in today’s complex SoCs. In this presentation, we will explain how a scalable system of embedded functional monitors combined with embedded and host/cloud based analytic software can provide actionable data and insights that helps debug, validate, and optimize RISC-V SoC devices and systems from lab bring-up to reliable large scale deployment.

A Safe Software Convergence: How Automotive and Industrial Designs are Eliminating Boundaries and Creating Opportunities
T2.3.01, Wednesday 14 at 11:30, in Gaston Berger amphitheater (S2).
By Edward Wilford, Senior Research Manager, Omdia.
Abstract: For decades, the automotive sector has been considered something of an island, with a high moat and a unique development cycle. However, in recent years and spurred mainly by a rich crop of new entrants from China, automotive technology has accelerated and broadened. A new focus on more general-purpose compute, driven by a software-first approach, has as an unintended but beneficial consequence opened up the barriers between automotive and industrial applications, and paved the way for product development shaped more by function than application. This talk will demonstrate that the various software-defined system revolutions are in fact a single phenomenon happening across industries, anywhere where advanced edge deployments are on the rise. Furthermore, why this presents itself as a unique opportunity for RISC-V will be discussed.

RISC-V: Powering the Future of High Performance Computing?
T2.5.01, Wednesday 14 at 14:30, in Gaston Berger amphitheater (S2).
By Nick Brown, Senior Research Fellow, ECC.
Abstract: For all it’s successes in embedded computing, RISC-V is yet to become mainstream in High Performance Computing (HPC). However, times are changing and at the same time that RISC-V is making progress towards more high end usage, the HPC community is facing unprecedented challenges around meeting the demand for increased performance but in a more sustainable manner. RISC-V has an opportunity to displace entrenched technologies here, and in this talk I will highlight the key benefits that RISC-V can provide to HPC, describe some of the important activities and early achievements in this area, and identify critical missing pieces that we as the RISC-V community should look to prioritise.
Bio:
I am interested in the role that novel hardware can play in future supercomputers, and am specifically motivated by the grand-challenge of how we can ensure scientific programmers are able to effectively exploit such technologies without extensive hardware/architecture expertise.

I coordinate knowledge exchange for the ExCALIBUR exascale software programme, and chair the RISC-V International HPC SIG.

Chips JU and the Vehicle of the Future – a RISC V view
T2.7.01, Wednesday 14 at 16:30, in Gaston Berger amphitheater (S2).
By Georgi Kuzmanov, Senior Programme Officer, Chips JU.
Abstract: The Chips Joint Undertaking (JU) was established in September, 2023, to implement the Chips for Europe Initiative, the first pillar of the European Chips Act and to continue the missions of its preceding joint technology initiatives in the field of electronic components and systems (ECS). For several years now, the Chips JU has been supporting two topics of common European interest, namely– Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) and RISC V based design of ECS. These two topics, initially pursued independently, have naturally converged into joint actions targeting the development of industrially significant RISC V based platforms, which support the digital Vehicle-of-the-Future (VoF) paradigm. This talk will reveal the evolution and the current state-of-play of Chips JU’s activities in the fields of SDV and RISC V. The context will be the inevitable transformation of traditional automotive industry towards digitalization to meet the global challenges in the sector.
Chips JU’s vision to employ RISC V based systems supporting SDV via hardware abstraction and consequently building a holistic digital platform for the VoF will be argued. This approach is seen as an advantageous strategic choice with significant potential impact, leading towards European technological sovereignty and more cost-efficient, thus more competitive and innovative, car manufacturing.

By Lucana
Santos, Microelectronics Engineer, ESA.
Abstract: RISC-V in space is becoming a tangible reality, with several missions already flying it. This presentation highlights the European Space Agency (ESA) latest developments to advance the adoption of this open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) in space systems. The portfolio of RISC-V centred System-on-Chip (SoC) for space is growing, with new devices soon going to be manufactured and offered in the market. Such SoCs bring unique space-related features as well as technical and programmatical challenges, which are presented in this talk. RISC-V in space is further supported by ESA by promoting the design and implementation of high-performance, reliable IP cores, and the establishment of a robust software ecosystem. In addition, the Ultra Deep Submicron (UDSM) initiative will be presented, showing how advanced semiconductor technology development is further accelerating the integration of RISC-V into space-grade electronics. These advancements will enable future space missions and projects to fully leverage the benefits of an open, flexible, and scalable ISA, fostering innovation, reducing dependency on proprietary technologies, and enhancing long-term sustainability in the space industry.
