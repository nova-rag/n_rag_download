Introduction¶
The RISC-V target provides code generation for processors implementing
supported variations of the RISC-V specification.
It lives in the
llvm/lib/Target/RISCV directory.
Specification Documents¶
There have been a number of revisions to the RISC-V specifications. LLVM aims
to implement the most recent ratified version of the standard RISC-V base ISAs
and ISA extensions with pragmatic variances. The most recent specification can
be found at: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/.
The official RISC-V International specification page. is also worth checking, but
tends to significantly lag the specifications linked above. Make sure to check
the wiki for not yet integrated extensions and note
that in addition, we sometimes carry support for extensions that have not yet
been ratified (these will be marked as experimental - see below) and support
various vendor-specific extensions (see below).
The current known variances from the specification are:
Unconditionally allowing instructions from zifencei, zicsr, zicntr, and
zihpm without gating them on the extensions being enabled.
Previous
revisions of the specification included these instructions in the base
ISA, and we preserve this behavior to avoid breaking existing code.
If
a future revision of the specification reuses these opcodes for other
extensions, we may need to reevaluate this choice, and thus recommend
users migrate build systems so as not to rely on this.
Allowing CSRs to be named without gating on specific extensions.
This
applies to all CSR names, not just those in zicsr, zicntr, and zihpm.
The ordering of z*, s*, and x* prefixed extension names is not
enforced in user-specified ISA naming strings (e.g. -march).
We are actively deciding not to support multiple specification revisions
at this time. We acknowledge a likely future need, but actively defer the
decisions making around handling this until we have a concrete example of
real hardware having shipped and an incompatible change to the
specification made afterwards.
Base ISAs¶
The specification defines five base instruction sets: RV32I, RV32E, RV64I,
RV64E, and RV128I. Currently, LLVM fully supports RV32I, and RV64I.
RV32E and
RV64E are supported by the assembly-based tools only.
RV128I is not supported.
To specify the target triple:
Table 107 RISC-V Architectures¶
Architecture
Description
riscv32
RISC-V with XLEN=32 (i.e. RV32I or RV32E)
riscv64
RISC-V with XLEN=64 (i.e. RV64I or RV64E)
To select an E variant ISA (e.g. RV32E instead of RV32I), use the base
architecture string (e.g. riscv32) with the extension e.
Profiles¶
Supported profile names can be passed using -march instead of a standard
ISA naming string. Currently supported profiles:
rvi20u32
rvi20u64
rva20u64
rva20s64
rva22u64
rva22s64
Note that you can also append additional extension names to be enabled, e.g.
rva20u64_zicond will enable the zicond extension in addition to those
in the rva20u64 profile.
Profiles that are not yet ratified cannot be used unless
-menable-experimental-extensions (or equivalent for other tools) is
specified. This applies to the following profiles:
rva23u64
rva23s64
rvb23u64
rvb23s64
rvm23u32
Extensions¶
The following table provides a status summary for extensions which have been
ratified and thus have finalized specifications.
When relevant, detailed notes
on support follow.

Assembly SupportLLVM supports the associated instructions in assembly.
All assembly related tools (e.g. assembler, disassembler, llvm-objdump, etc..) are supported.
Compiler and linker will accept extension names, and linked binaries will contain appropriate ELF flags and attributes to reflect use of named extension.
SupportedFully supported by the compiler.
This includes everything in Assembly Support, along with - if relevant - C language intrinsics for the instructions and pattern matching by the compiler to recognize idiomatic patterns which can be lowered to the associated instructions.
ESupport of RV32E/RV64E and ilp32e/lp64e ABIs are experimental. To be compatible with the implementation of ilp32e in GCC, we don’t use aligned registers to pass variadic arguments. Furthermore, we set the stack alignment to 4 bytes for types with length of 2*XLEN.
Zbkb, ZbkxPattern matching support for these instructions is incomplete.
Zknd, Zkne, Zknh, Zksed, ZkshNo pattern matching exists.
As a result, these instructions can only be used from assembler or via intrinsic calls.
Zve32x, Zve32f, Zvl32bLLVM currently assumes a minimum VLEN (vector register width) of 64 bits during compilation, and as a result Zve32x and Zve32f are supported only for VLEN>=64.
Assembly support doesn’t have this restriction.
Zicntr, Zicsr, Zifencei, ZihpmBetween versions 2.0 and 2.1 of the base I specification, a backwards incompatible change was made to remove selected instructions and CSRs from the base ISA.
These instructions were grouped into a set of new extensions, but were no longer required by the base ISA.
This change is partially described in “Preface to Document Version 20190608-Base-Ratified” from the specification document (the zicntr and zihpm bits are not mentioned).
LLVM currently implements version 2.1 of the base specification. To maintain compatibility, instructions from these extensions are accepted without being in the -march string.
LLVM also allows the explicit specification of the extensions in an -march string.
Za128rs, Za64rs, Zama16b, Zic64b, Ziccamoa, Ziccif, Zicclsm, Ziccrse, Shcounterenvw, Shgatpa, Shtvala, Shvsatpa, Shvstvala, Shvstvecd, Ssccptr, Sscounterenw, Ssstateen, Ssstrict, Sstvala, Sstvecd, Ssu64xl, Svade, SvbareThese extensions are defined as part of the RISC-V Profiles specification.
They do not introduce any new features themselves, but instead describe existing hardware features.
Zacasamocas.w will be used for i32 cmpxchg. amocas.d will be used i64 cmpxchg on RV64. The compiler will not generate amocas.d on RV32 or amocas.q on RV64 due to ABI compatibilty. These can only be used in the assembler.
Experimental Extensions¶
LLVM supports (to various degrees) a number of experimental extensions.
All experimental extensions have experimental- as a prefix.
There is explicitly no compatibility promised between versions of the toolchain, and regular users are strongly advised not to make use of experimental extensions before they reach ratification.
The primary goal of experimental support is to assist in the process of ratification by providing an existence proof of an implementation, and simplifying efforts to validate the value of a proposed extension against large code bases.
Experimental extensions are expected to either transition to ratified status, or be eventually removed.
The decision on whether to accept an experimental extension is currently done on an entirely case by case basis; if you want to propose one, attending the bi-weekly RISC-V sync-up call is strongly advised.
experimental-ssnpm, experimental-smnpm, experimental-smmpm, experimental-sspm, experimental-supmLLVM implements the v1.0.0-rc2 specification.
experimental-ssqosidLLVM implements assembler support for the v1.0-rc1 draft specification.
experimental-zalasrLLVM implements the 0.0.5 draft specification.
experimental-zicfilp, experimental-zicfissLLVM implements the 1.0 release specification.
To use an experimental extension from clang, you must add -menable-experimental-extensions to the command line, and specify the exact version of the experimental extension you are using.
To use an experimental extension with LLVM’s internal developer tools (e.g. llc, llvm-objdump, llvm-mc), you must prefix the extension name with experimental-.
Note that you don’t need to specify the version with internal tools, and shouldn’t include the experimental- prefix with clang.
Vendor Extensions¶
Vendor extensions are extensions which are not standardized by RISC-V International, and are instead defined by a hardware vendor.
The term vendor extension roughly parallels the definition of a non-standard extension from Section 1.3 of the Volume I: RISC-V Unprivileged ISA specification.
In particular, we expect to eventually accept both custom extensions and non-conforming extensions.
Inclusion of a vendor extension will be considered on a case by case basis.
All proposals should be brought to the bi-weekly RISCV sync calls for discussion.
For a general idea of the factors likely to be considered, please see the Clang documentation.
It is our intention to follow the naming conventions described in riscv-non-isa/riscv-toolchain-conventions.
Exceptions to this naming will need to be strongly motivated.

Experimental C Intrinsics¶
In some cases an extension is non-experimental but the C intrinsics for that
extension are still experimental.
To use C intrinsics for such an extension
from clang, you must add -menable-experimental-extensions to the command
line.
This currently applies to the following extensions:
Zvbb
Zvbc
Zvkb
Zvkg
Zvkn
Zvknc
Zvkned
