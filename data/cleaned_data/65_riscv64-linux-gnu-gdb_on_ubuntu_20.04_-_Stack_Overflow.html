I had the same problem, but solved it by using "gdb-multiarch" instead.
sudo apt-get install gdb-multiarch

Thank you! I ended up compiling from source, as gdb-multiarch gave me the warning message "Architecture rejected target-supplied description." I guess there is something wrong with the Ubuntu package distirbution.

for those who still can't debug the kernel, you may need to check the warning of gdb-multiarch.
you may need to add-auto-load-safe-path /path/to/the/lab/.gdbinit to /home/<your_username>/.config/gdb/gdbinit
