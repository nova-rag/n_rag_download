From QEMU
Description
RISC-V is an open source instruction set. It is a modular with only a small set of mandatory instructions. Every other module might be implemented by vendors
allowing RISC-V to be suitable for small embedded systems up to large supercomputers.
Build Directions
For RV64:
./configure --target-list=riscv64-softmmu && make
For RV32:
./configure --target-list=riscv32-softmmu && make
Booting Linux
Booting 64-bit Debian
Follow the instructions on the Debian wiki to boot Debian on QEMU: https://wiki.debian.org/RISC-V
Booting 64-bit Fedora
Download the Fedora prebuilt images from: https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/risc-v/repo/virt-builder-images/images/
You will want to download Fedora-Minimal-Rawhide-*-fw_payload-uboot-qemu-virt-smode.elf and Fedora-Minimal-Rawhide-*-sda.raw.xz images
Decompress the rootFS:
unxz Fedora-Minimal-Rawhide-*-sda.raw.xz
Boot linux using RV64GC qemu:
qemu-system-riscv64 \
-nographic \
-machine virt \
-smp 4 \
-m 2G \
-kernel Fedora-Minimal-Rawhide-*-fw_payload-uboot-qemu-virt-smode.elf \

For more details on running Fedora see the Fedora Wiki: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/RISC-V/Installing
Booting 32-bit OpenEmbedded Images
Follow the usual OpenEmbedded build flow using meta-riscv to build for the qemuriscv32 machine.
MACHINE=qemuriscv32 bitbake core-image-minimal; runqemu qemuriscv32
More details on doing this can be found here: https://github.com/riscv/meta-riscv/#build-image
When using OpenEmbedded it is recommended to use the runqemu script to boot QEMU. It will dynamically handle display options as well as advanced networking.

Microchip PolarFire SoC Icicle Kit
QEMU 5.2.0 supports a new machine: Microchip PolarFire SoC Icicle Kit. The Icicle Kit board integrates a PolarFire SoC, with one SiFive's E51 plus four U54 cores and many on-chip peripherals and an FPGA.
For more details about Microchip PolarFire Soc, please see:
https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/soc-fpgas/5498-polarfire-soc-fpga
The Icicle Kit board information can be found here:
https://www.microsemi.com/existing-parts/parts/152514
Boot the images:
qemu-system-riscv64 -M microchip-icicle-kit -smp 5 \
-bios path/to/hss.bin -sd path/to/sdcard.img \
-nic user,model=cadence_gem \
-nic tap,ifname=tap,model=cadence_gem,script=no \
-display none -serial stdio \
-chardev socket,id=serial1,path=serial1.sock,server,wait \
-serial chardev:serial1
The BIOS image used by this machine is hss.bin, aka Hart Software Services, which can be built from: https://github.com/polarfire-soc/hart-software-services
QEMU does not support eMMC hence the SD configuration shall be used in the HSS and Yocto BSP build. The eMMC configuration is not supported.
Instructions to build HSS:
$ cp boards/icicle-kit-es/def_config.sdcard .config
$ make BOARD=icicle-kit-es
The following commit of HSS was tested:
commit 078ce16d8cb3a89e4c3e93916621b816dbdaa274

Merge pull request #7 from avpatel/custom_boot_flow_v1
Custom boot flow for PolarFire boards
For Yocto build, "MACHINE=icicle-kit-es-sd" should be specified, otherwise when booting Linux kernel the rootfs cannot be mounted. The generated image is something like: mpfs-dev-cli-icicle-kit-es-sd.rootfs.wic. Resize the file with 'qemu-image' to a power of 2 before passing to QEMU '-sd' command line.
The following commands download the official SD card image released by Microchip and prepare it for QEMU usage:
$ wget ftp://ftpsoc.microsemi.com/outgoing/core-image-minimal-dev-icicle-kit-es-sd-20201009141623.rootfs.wic.gz
$ gunzip core-image-minimal-dev-icicle-kit-es-sd-20201009141623.rootfs.wic.gz
$ qemu-img resize core-image-minimal-dev-icicle-kit-es-sd-20201009141623.rootfs.wic 4G
The memory is set to 1537 MiB by default which is the minimum required high memory size by HSS. A sanity check on ram size is performed in the machine init routine to prompt user to increase the RAM size to > 1537 MiB when less than 1537 MiB ram is detected.
HSS output is on the first serial port (stdio) and U-Boot/Linux outputs on the 2nd serial port. OpenSBI outputs on a random serial port due to the lottery mechanism used during the multi-core boot.
Attaching GDB
To attach GDB to a QEMU RISC-V instance with only a single cluster (every machine except the sifive_u) run these commands from GDB:
target extended-remote :1234
info threads
To attach GDB to a QEMU RISC-V instance with multiple clusters (the sifive_u) run these commands from GDB:
target extended-remote :1234
add-inferior
inferior 2
attach 2
set schedule-multiple
info threads
The above commands assume the default GDB port exposed from QEMU of 1234. This will happen when you run QEMU with the '-s' command line argument.
If you would like QEMU to not run the guest until you have connected GDB, you can specify the '-S' command line argument as well.
RISC-V Foundation Extensions
As RISC-V has a range of possible extensions, QEMU has guidelines for
supporting them all.
If an extension is frozen or ratified by the RISC-V foundation, it can
be supported in QEMU. Generally we will try to support as many versions
as feasible, following the usual QEMU deprecation policy to remove old
versions.
If an official RISC-V foundation extension is in a reasonable draft
state, that is not too many changes are still expected, it can be
supported experimentally by QEMU. Experimental support means it must
be disabled by default and marked with a "x-" in the CPU/board properties.
Draft extensions should also include the version information in the property.
Draft extensions can be enabled by specific CPUs or boards if the hardware
supports that extension.
QEMU will only support the latest version of patches submitted for a draft
extension. A draft extension can also be removed at any time and does not
follow QEMU's deprecation policy.
RISC-V Custom Extensions/Instructions
Support for custom instruction set extensions are an important part of RISC-V,
with large encoding spaces reserved of vendor extensions.
QEMU follows similar rules to the RISC-V toolchain convention, as described
here: https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-toolchain-conventions/pull/17
QEMU will support vendor extensions. Vendor extensions must be
disabled by default, but can be enabled for specific vendor CPUs and
boards. The vendor extensions should use prefixes and names as described in
https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-toolchain-conventions
Vendor extensions must be maintained and tested by the vendor. Upstream will
take efforts to not break extensions, but testing and bug fixes should be
done by the vendor. Patches to add support for open source toolchains are
unlikely to be accepted without specification documents being made available
publicly.
Vendor extensions can not interfere with other extensions and can not
be obtrusive to the core RISC-V target code.
If you are looking to add support for vendor extensions, it is recommended
that you get involved in the QEMU review process. It is also recommended that
you send your patches as early as possible to get community feedback before
they are fully implemented. This is especially important if you are modifying
core code.
