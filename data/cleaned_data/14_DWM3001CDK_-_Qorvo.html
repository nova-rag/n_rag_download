Evaluation Tools
Qorvo's DWM3001CDK has been developed as a design kit for the DWM3001C fully integrated (UWB) module based on the Qorvo DW3110 IC. This kit can be used to evaluate hardware performance as a TWR or TDoA Tag and build an evaluation real time location system (RTLS).
Two micro USB ports connect to the J-Link and DWM3001C USB interface. An on-board J-Link debugger provides SWD and UART interfaces to the DWM3001C. Two micro USB ports connect to the J-Link and DWM3001C USB interface. The board can be powered from either of these USB ports, a Raspberry Pi interface, a battery or an external power supply.
The DWM3001CDK is interoperable with the Apple U1 & U2 chip.
The DWM3001C is designed to be compliant to the FiRa™ PHY and MAC specifications enabling interoperability with other FiRa™ compliant devices.
