Qorvo Accelerates Industrial IoT Adoption with Fully Integrated UWB Module
July 25, 2022
DWM3001CDK Development Kit
Qorvo's DWM3001CDK Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Transceiver Development Kit is a development kit that features the DWM3001C module. This kit can be used to evaluate hardware performance as a TWR or TDoA Tag and build an evaluation real time location system (RTLS).
Two micro USB ports connect to the J-Link and DWM3001C USB interface. An on-board J-Link debugger provides SWD and UART interfaces to the DWM3001C. Two micro USB ports connect to the J-Link and DWM3001C USB interface. The board can be powered from either of these USB ports, a Raspberry Pi interface, a battery or an external power supply.
The DWM3001CDK is interoperable with the Apple U1 chip.
QM33120WDK1 Development Kit
Qorvo's QM33120WDK1 consists of two different daughter boards (AoA and non-AoA) mounted on two Nordic nRF52840 DK evaluation boards. Application firmware development is facilitated by the features of the Nordic boards such as on-board J-Link debugger, USB and Bluetooth® Low Energy interfaces.
The QM33120WDK1 is designed to develop applications compatible with PHY and MAC FiRa™ specifications.
Third-Party Solutions
SynchronicIT Omlox Tag Stack
