Introduction¶
The RISC-V target provides code generation for processors implementing
supported variations of the RISC-V specification.
It lives in the
llvm/lib/Target/RISCV directory.
Specification Documents¶
There have been a number of revisions to the RISC-V specifications. LLVM aims
to implement the most recent ratified version of the standard RISC-V base ISAs
and ISA extensions with pragmatic variances. The most recent specification can
be found at: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/.
The official RISC-V International specification page. is also worth checking, but
tends to significantly lag the specifications linked above. Make sure to check
the wiki for not yet integrated extensions and note
that in addition, we sometimes carry support for extensions that have not yet
been ratified (these will be marked as experimental - see below) and support
various vendor-specific extensions (see below).
The current known variances from the specification are:
Unconditionally allowing instructions from zifencei, zicsr, zicntr, and
zihpm without gating them on the extensions being enabled.
Previous
revisions of the specification included these instructions in the base
ISA, and we preserve this behavior to avoid breaking existing code.
If
a future revision of the specification reuses these opcodes for other
extensions, we may need to reevaluate this choice, and thus recommend
users migrate build systems so as not to rely on this.
Allowing CSRs to be named without gating on specific extensions.
This
applies to all CSR names, not just those in zicsr, zicntr, and zihpm.
The ordering of z*, s*, and x* prefixed extension names is not
enforced in user-specified ISA naming strings (e.g. -march).
We are actively deciding not to support multiple specification revisions
at this time. We acknowledge a likely future need, but actively defer the
decisions making around handling this until we have a concrete example of
real hardware having shipped and an incompatible change to the
specification made afterwards.
Base ISAs¶
The specification defines five base instruction sets: RV32I, RV32E, RV64I,
RV64E, and RV128I. Currently, LLVM fully supports RV32I, and RV64I.
RV32E and
RV64E are supported by the assembly-based tools only.
RV128I is not supported.
To specify the target triple:
Table 118 RISC-V Architectures¶
Architecture
Description
riscv32
RISC-V with XLEN=32 (i.e. RV32I or RV32E)
riscv64
RISC-V with XLEN=64 (i.e. RV64I or RV64E)
To select an E variant ISA (e.g. RV32E instead of RV32I), use the base
architecture string (e.g. riscv32) with the extension e.
Profiles¶
Supported profile names can be passed using -march instead of a standard
ISA naming string. Currently supported profiles:
rvi20u32
rvi20u64
rva20u64
rva20s64
rva22u64
rva22s64
rva23u64
rva23s64
rvb23u64
rvb23s64
Note that you can also append additional extension names to be enabled, e.g.
rva20u64_zicond will enable the zicond extension in addition to those
in the rva20u64 profile.
Profiles that are not yet ratified cannot be used unless
-menable-experimental-extensions (or equivalent for other tools) is
specified. This applies to the following profiles:
rvm23u32

Assembly SupportLLVM supports the associated instructions in assembly.
All assembly related tools (e.g. assembler, disassembler, llvm-objdump, etc..) are supported.
Compiler and linker will accept extension names, and linked binaries will contain appropriate ELF flags and attributes to reflect use of named extension.
SupportedFully supported by the compiler.
This includes everything in Assembly Support, along with - if relevant - C language intrinsics for the instructions and pattern matching by the compiler to recognize idiomatic patterns which can be lowered to the associated instructions.
ESupport of RV32E/RV64E and ilp32e/lp64e ABIs are experimental. To be compatible with the implementation of ilp32e in GCC, we don’t use aligned registers to pass variadic arguments. Furthermore, we set the stack alignment to 4 bytes for types with length of 2*XLEN.
Zbkb, ZbkxPattern matching support for these instructions is incomplete.
Zknd, Zkne, Zknh, Zksed, ZkshNo pattern matching exists.
As a result, these instructions can only be used from assembler or via intrinsic calls.
Zvbc, Zvkg, Zvkn, Zvknc, Zvkned, Zvkng, Zvknha, Zvknhb, Zvks, Zvks, Zvks, Zvksc, Zvksed, Zvksg, Zvksh.No pattern matching exists. As a result, these instructions can only be used from assembler or via intrinsic calls.
Zve32x, Zve32f, Zvl32bLLVM currently assumes a minimum VLEN (vector register width) of 64 bits during compilation, and as a result Zve32x and Zve32f are supported only for VLEN>=64.
Assembly support doesn’t have this restriction.
Zicntr, Zicsr, Zifencei, ZihpmBetween versions 2.0 and 2.1 of the base I specification, a backwards incompatible change was made to remove selected instructions and CSRs from the base ISA.
These instructions were grouped into a set of new extensions, but were no longer required by the base ISA.
This change is partially described in “Preface to Document Version 20190608-Base-Ratified” from the specification document (the zicntr and zihpm bits are not mentioned).
LLVM currently implements version 2.1 of the base specification. To maintain compatibility, instructions from these extensions are accepted without being in the -march string.
LLVM also allows the explicit specification of the extensions in an -march string.
Za128rs, Za64rs, Zama16b, Zic64b, Ziccamoa, Ziccamoc, Ziccif, Zicclsm, Ziccrse, Shcounterenvw, Shgatpa, Shtvala, Shvsatpa, Shvstvala, Shvstvecd, Ssccptr, Sscounterenw, Ssstateen, Ssstrict, Sstvala, Sstvecd, Ssu64xl, Svade, SvbareThese extensions are defined as part of the RISC-V Profiles specification.
They do not introduce any new features themselves, but instead describe existing hardware features.
ZacasThe compiler will not generate amocas.d on RV32 or amocas.q on RV64 due to ABI compatibilty. These can only be used in the assembler.
Atomics ABIs¶
At the time of writing there are three atomics mappings (ABIs) defined for RISC-V.
As of LLVM 19, LLVM defaults to “A6S”, which is compatible with both the original “A6” and the future “A7” ABI. See the psABI atomics document for more information on these mappings.
Note that although the “A6S” mapping is used, the ELF attribute recording the mapping isn’t currently emitted by default due to a bug causing a crash in older versions of binutils when processing files containing this attribute.
Experimental Extensions¶
LLVM supports (to various degrees) a number of experimental extensions.
All experimental extensions have experimental- as a prefix.
There is explicitly no compatibility promised between versions of the toolchain, and regular users are strongly advised not to make use of experimental extensions before they reach ratification.
The primary goal of experimental support is to assist in the process of ratification by providing an existence proof of an implementation, and simplifying efforts to validate the value of a proposed extension against large code bases.
Experimental extensions are expected to either transition to ratified status, or be eventually removed.
The decision on whether to accept an experimental extension is currently done on an entirely case by case basis; if you want to propose one, attending the bi-weekly RISC-V sync-up call is strongly advised.
experimental-zalasrLLVM implements the 0.0.5 draft specification.
experimental-zicfilp, experimental-zicfissLLVM implements the 1.0 release specification.
experimental-zvbc32e, experimental-zvkgsLLVM implements the 0.7 release specification.
experimental-sdext, experimental-sdtrigLLVM implements the 1.0-rc4 specification.
experimental-smctr, experimental-ssctrLLVM implements the 1.0-rc3 specification.
experimental-svukteLLVM implements the 0.3 draft specification.
experimental-zvqdotqLLVM implements the 0.0.1 draft specification.
To use an experimental extension from clang, you must add -menable-experimental-extensions to the command line, and specify the exact version of the experimental extension you are using.
To use an experimental extension with LLVM’s internal developer tools (e.g. llc, llvm-objdump, llvm-mc), you must prefix the extension name with experimental-.
Note that you don’t need to specify the version with internal tools, and shouldn’t include the experimental- prefix with clang.
Vendor Extensions¶
Vendor extensions are extensions which are not standardized by RISC-V International, and are instead defined by a hardware vendor.
The term vendor extension roughly parallels the definition of a non-standard extension from Section 1.3 of the Volume I: RISC-V Unprivileged ISA specification.
In particular, we expect to eventually accept both custom extensions and non-conforming extensions.
Inclusion of a vendor extension will be considered on a case by case basis.
All proposals should be brought to the bi-weekly RISC-V sync calls for discussion.
For a general idea of the factors likely to be considered, please see the Clang documentation.
It is our intention to follow the naming conventions described in riscv-non-isa/riscv-toolchain-conventions.
Exceptions to this naming will need to be strongly motivated.

All instructions are prefixed with nds. as described in the specification.
Experimental C Intrinsics¶
In some cases an extension is non-experimental but the C intrinsics for that
extension are still experimental.
To use C intrinsics for such an extension
from clang, you must add -menable-experimental-extensions to the command
line.
This currently applies to the following extensions:
No extensions have experimental intrinsics.
Long (>32-bit) Instruction Support¶
RISC-V is a variable-length ISA, but the standard currently only defines 16- and 32-bit instructions. The specification describes longer instruction encodings, but these are not ratified.
The LLVM disassembler, llvm-objdump, does use the longer instruction encodings described in the specification to guess the instruction length (up to 176 bits) and will group the disassembly view of encoding bytes correspondingly.
The LLVM integrated assembler for RISC-V supports two different kinds of .insn directive, for assembling instructions that LLVM does not yet support:
.insn type, args* which takes a known instruction type, and a list of fields. You are strongly recommended to use this variant of the directive if your instruction fits an existing instruction type.
.insn [ length , ] encoding which takes an (optional) explicit length (in bytes) and a raw encoding for the instruction. When given an explicit length, this variant can encode instructions up to 64 bits long. The encoding part of the directive must be given all bits for the instruction, none are filled in for the user. When used without the optional length, this variant of the directive will use the LSBs of the raw encoding to work out if an instruction is 16 or 32 bits long. LLVM does not infer that an instruction might be longer than 32 bits - in this case, the user must give the length explicitly.
It is strongly recommended to use the .insn directive for assembling unsupported instructions instead of .word or .hword, because it will produce the correct mapping symbols to mark the word as an instruction, not data.
Global Pointer (GP) Relaxation and the Small Data Limit¶
Some of the RISC-V psABI variants reserve gp (x3) for use as a “Global Pointer”, to make generating data addresses more efficient.
To use this functionality, you need to be doing all of the following:
Use the medlow (aka small) code model;
Not use the gp register for any other uses (some platforms use it for the shadow stack and others as a temporary – as denoted by the Tag_RISCV_x3_reg_usage build attribute);
Compile your objects with Clang’s -mrelax option, to enable relaxation annotations on relocatable objects (this is the default, but -mno-relax disables these relaxation annotations);
Compile for a position-dependent static executable (not a shared library, and -fno-PIC / -fno-pic / -fno-pie); and
Use LLD’s --relax-gp option.
LLD will relax (rewrite) any code sequences that materialize an address within 2048 bytes of __global_pointer$ (which will be defined if it is used and does not already exist) to instead generate the address using gp and the correct (signed) 12-bit immediate. This usually saves at least one instruction compared to materialising a full 32-bit address value.
There can only be one gp value in a process (as gp is not changed when calling into a function in a shared library), so the symbol is is only defined and this relaxation is only done for executables, and not for shared libraries. The linker expects executable startup code to put the value of __global_pointer$ (from the executable) into gp before any user code is run.
Arguably, the most efficient use for this addressing mode is for smaller global variables, as larger global variables likely need many more loads or stores when they are being accessed anyway, so the cost of materializing the upper bits can be shared.
Therefore the compiler can place smaller global variables into sections with names starting with .sdata or .sbss (matching sections with names starting with .data and .bss respectively). LLD knows to define the global_pointer$ symbol close to these sections, and to lay these sections out adjacent to the .data section.
Clang’s -msmall-data-limit= option controls what the threshold size is (in bytes) for a global variable to be considered small. -msmall-data-limit=0 disables the use of sections starting .sdata and .sbss. The -msmall-data-limit= option will not move global variables that have an explicit data section, and will keep globals in separate sections if you are using -fdata-sections.
The small data limit threshold is also used to separate small constants into sections with names starting with .srodata. LLD does not place these with the .sdata and .sbss sections as .srodata sections are read only and the other two are writable. Instead the .srodata sections are placed adjacent to .rodata.
Data suggests that these options can produce significant improvements across a range of benchmarks.
