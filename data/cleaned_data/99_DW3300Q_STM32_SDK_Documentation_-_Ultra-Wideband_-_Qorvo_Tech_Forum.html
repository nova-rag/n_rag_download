Hello!
I’m a firmware design engineer, and along with my team, we’re working on UWB development. We recently received a Qorvo kit (DW3300QDK1) along with the EVB STM32 Nucleo-F429ZI to work with your SDK. However, we couldn’t find any documentation (developer/user manual, guides) on using your SDK with the EVB STM32 Nucleo-F429ZI. Where can we access that information?
I’ll appreciate your support.
