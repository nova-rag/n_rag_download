Overview​
xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC is a
standalone, cross-platform (Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux) binary
distribution of GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC,
aimed at reproducible builds.
What are reproducible operations?To be reproducible, an operation must remain stable over time and
across different environments. In other words, if the same operation is repeated
after some time, possibly on a different machine or platform, the
resulting behaviour must be functionally equivalent.
GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC is the RISC-V cross-compiler variant of
the GNU Compiler Collection,
an open source project maintained by the
Free Software Foundation.
infoIn this context, embedded refers exclusively to bare-metal systems,
not embedded Linux, which necessitates a different toolchain for building
Linux user space applications.
The open source xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC project is hosted on GitHub as
xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack;
it provides the platform specific binaries as
release assets.
In addition to the binary archives and the package metadata,
this project also includes the
build scripts.
Upgrade noticeThis project replaces the deprecated
xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-embed-gcc-xpack
project, which followed the
SiFive releases;
in order to have access to further versions,
it is recommended to update your projects.
What are xpm packages? (xPacks)​
xpm packages, abbreviated as xPacks, are versatile,
language-neutral software packages. They have been successfully
utilised in C/C++ projects.
What the heck are xpm packages (xPacks)? Please, do not introduce another package format!Although the initial appearance may seem complex, utilising
xpm packages is, in fact, straightforward.
The design rationale is to automate frequent
operations that occur during software development, such as the
installation of
dependencies, and to ensure reproducibility.These packages are managed by xpm
(the xPack Project Manager),
a programme that complements the npm CLI
(the popular JavaScript package manager), with new language-neutral features.The xPacks Framework does NOT introduce a new package format; instead,
it uses the same format as npm packages, which is a collection of
files/folders and a package.json file with the package metadata.xpm can install packages from the
same repositories as npm, whether public or private.The packages (usually regular archives, but also git repositories),
are extracted into separate folders within the project.Based on the content, there are two types of xpm packages:
packages with source libraries (source xpm packages)
packages with executables, usually platform-specific binary
tools (binary xpm packages)
Source xpm packages are regular npm packages that include library
source files, typically in C/C++, though there are no language
restrictions.Binary xpm packages are also regular npm packages, but with minimal
content, typically just the package.json file. Since these packages
provide executables for multiple platforms, some of which are quite
large, it is not practical to include all binaries within the npm
package itself. Instead, the package.json file contains references
(URLs) to platform-specific binary archives (e.g., .tar.gz for Unix or
.zip for Windows).These archives are also expanded along with the package metadata.
Links/forwarders to
these executables are created in a .bin folder,
eliminating the need to add multiple folders to the PATH.In summary, xpm packages can enhance and automate the installation
process for source libraries and tools.In summary, xpm packages can streamline and automate the installation
process for source libraries and tools. Further details are available on the
xpm Concepts page.
Features​
All binaries are:
Self-contained (include all required libraries).
File-system relocatable (can be installed in any location).
Built on slightly older systems (to ensure compatibility with both
old and new systems).
Compatibility with older systemsGiven that most operating systems maintain significant compatibility
with older versions, building an application on an older system ensures
that the same binary can run on newer versions. Conversely, building an
application on a newer system may utilize library features that are
not available in older versions, making backward compatibility less
feasible.
Similarly to flatpacks or snap,
but significantly simpler, xpm packages include all dependent shared libraries
within the distributed archives, making the binaries independent of
any similar libraries installed on the system. This ensures they
can run on any system without needing specific libraries to be
installed.
Also the builds are configured so that the binaries do not depend on
being installed in specific folders, and can be installed in any
location, including in user folders.
Benefits​
The main advantages of using the xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC are:
A convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade
procedure; the same procedure is used for all major
platforms (x64 Windows, x64 macOS, arm64 macOS, x64 GNU/Linux, arm64 GNU/Linux).
Multiple versions of the same package can be installed at the same time on
the same system.
No need to worry about dependent libraries, they are all included.
Not affected by system updates that
might change the versions of the dependent libraries.
Significantly lighter and easier to use than Docker images that provide
similar functionality and are GNU/Linux centric.
Projects can be tied to specific tools versions; this provides a good
reproducibility, especially useful in CI/CD environments.
Compatibility​
The xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC project is fully compatible with the upstream
riscv32-*-elf and riscv64-*-elf variants of the
upstream GCC.
Install​
The executables and other related files can be installed automatically with
xpm or manually by downloading the
platform specific archives.
The details for installing the xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC on different platforms are
provided in the
Install Guide on the project's website.
Status​
The xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC project is fully functional,
stable, and suitable for use in production environments.
Documentation​
The original GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC documentation is available from the
GCC project web site:
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/
Release schedule​
This distribution generally follows the official
GCC release timeline.
For each major version there are 2 releases, like 14.1
in the first part of the year (tentatively April-May) and
14.2 in the second part
(tentatively in August-September).
Previous versions are maintained for 3 more years, and, around midyear,
GNU releases updates for the previous 3 versions,
(like 13.3, 12.4, 11.5).
Releases​
The list of releases is available in the Releases pages.
Change log​
The release and change log is available in the repository
CHANGELOG.md file.
