RISC-V Options (Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC))
Next: RL78 Options, Previous: PRU Options, Up: Machine-Dependent Options   [Contents][Index]
3.20.40 RISC-V Options ¶
These command-line options are defined for RISC-V targets:
-mbranch-cost=n ¶
Set the cost of branches to roughly n instructions.
-mplt ¶
-mno-plt
When generating PIC code, do or don’t allow the use of PLTs. Ignored for
non-PIC.
The default is -mplt.
-mabi=ABI-string ¶
Specify integer and floating-point calling convention.
ABI-string
contains two parts: the size of integer types and the registers used for
floating-point types.
For example ‘-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64d’ means that
‘long’ and pointers are 64-bit (implicitly defining ‘int’ to be
32-bit), and that floating-point values up to 64 bits wide are passed in F
registers.
Contrast this with ‘-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64f’, which still
allows the compiler to generate code that uses the F and D extensions but only
allows floating-point values up to 32 bits long to be passed in registers; or
‘-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64’, in which no floating-point arguments will be
passed in registers.
The default for this argument is system dependent, users who want a specific
calling convention should specify one explicitly.
The valid calling
conventions are: ‘ilp32’, ‘ilp32f’, ‘ilp32d’, ‘lp64’,
‘lp64f’, and ‘lp64d’.
Some calling conventions are impossible to
implement on some ISAs: for example, ‘-march=rv32if -mabi=ilp32d’ is
invalid because the ABI requires 64-bit values be passed in F registers, but F
registers are only 32 bits wide.
There are also the ‘ilp32e’ ABI that can
only be used with the ‘rv32e’ architecture and the ‘lp64e’ ABI that
can only be used with the ‘rv64e’.
Those ABIs are not well specified at
present, and are subject to change.
-mfdiv ¶
-mno-fdiv
Do or don’t use hardware floating-point divide and square root instructions.
This requires the F or D extensions for floating-point registers.
The default
is to use them if the specified architecture has these instructions.
-mfence-tso ¶
-mno-fence-tso
Do or don’t use the ‘fence.tso’ instruction, which is unimplemented on
some processors (including those from T-Head).
If the ‘fence.tso’
instruction is not available then a stronger fence is used instead.
-mdiv ¶
-mno-div
Do or don’t use hardware instructions for integer division.
This requires the
M extension.
The default is to use them if the specified architecture has
these instructions.
-misa-spec=ISA-spec-string ¶
Specify the version of the RISC-V Unprivileged (formerly User-Level)
ISA specification to produce code conforming to.
The possibilities
for ISA-spec-string are:
2.2
Produce code conforming to version 2.2.
20190608
Produce code conforming to version 20190608.
20191213
Produce code conforming to version 20191213.
The default is -misa-spec=20191213 unless GCC has been configured
with --with-isa-spec= specifying a different default version.
-march=ISA-string ¶
Generate code for given RISC-V ISA (e.g. ‘rv64im’).
ISA strings must be
lower-case.
Examples include ‘rv64i’, ‘rv32g’, ‘rv32e’, and
‘rv32imaf’. Additionally, a special value help
(-march=help) is accepted to list all supported extensions.
The syntax of the ISA string is defined as follows:
The string must start with ‘rv32’ or ‘rv64’, followed by
‘i’, ‘e’, or ‘g’, referred to as the base ISA.
The subsequent part of the string is a list of extension names. Extension
names can be categorized as multi-letter (e.g. ‘zba’) and single-letter
(e.g. ‘v’). Single-letter extensions can appear consecutively,
but multi-letter extensions must be separated by underscores.
An underscore can appear anywhere after the base ISA. It has no specific
effect but is used to improve readability and can act as a separator.
Extension names may include an optional version number, following the
syntax ‘<major>p<minor>’ or ‘<major>’, (e.g. ‘m2p1’ or
‘m2’).
Supported extension are listed below:

When -march= is not specified, use the setting from -mcpu.
If both -march and -mcpu= are not specified, the default for
this argument is system dependent, users who want a specific architecture
extensions should specify one explicitly.
When the RISC-V specifications define an extension as depending on other
extensions, GCC will implicitly add the dependent extensions to the enabled
extension set if they weren’t added explicitly.
-mcpu=processor-string ¶
Use architecture of and optimize the output for the given processor, specified
by particular CPU name.
Permissible values for this option are: ‘sifive-e20’, ‘sifive-e21’,
‘sifive-e24’, ‘sifive-e31’, ‘sifive-e34’, ‘sifive-e76’,
‘sifive-s21’, ‘sifive-s51’, ‘sifive-s54’, ‘sifive-s76’,
‘sifive-u54’, ‘sifive-u74’, ‘sifive-x280’, ‘sifive-xp450’,
‘sifive-x670’, ‘thead-c906’, ‘tt-ascalon-d8’, ‘xiangshan-nanhu’,
‘xt-c908’, ‘xt-c908v’, ‘xt-c910’, ‘xt-c910v2’,
‘xt-c920’, ‘xt-c920v2’.
Note that -mcpu does not override -march or -mtune.
-mtune=processor-string ¶
Optimize the output for the given processor, specified by microarchitecture or
particular CPU name.
Permissible values for this option are:
‘generic-ooo’, ‘rocket’, ‘sifive-3-series’,
‘sifive-5-series’, ‘sifive-7-series’, ‘size’,
‘sifive-p400-series’, ‘sifive-p600-series’, and all valid options for
-mcpu=.
When -mtune= is not specified, use the setting from -mcpu,
the default is ‘rocket’ if both are not specified.
The ‘size’ choice is not intended for use by end-users.
This is used
when -Os is specified.
It overrides the instruction cost info
provided by -mtune=, but does not override the pipeline info.
This
helps reduce code size while still giving good performance.
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=num ¶
Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to num
byte boundary.
If -mpreferred-stack-boundary is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128-bits).
Warning: If you use this switch, then you must build all modules with
the same value, including any libraries.
This includes the system libraries
and startup modules.
-msmall-data-limit=n ¶
Put global and static data smaller than n bytes into a special section
(on some targets).
-msave-restore ¶
-mno-save-restore
Do or don’t use smaller but slower prologue and epilogue code that uses
library function calls.
The default is to use fast inline prologues and
epilogues.
-mmovcc ¶
-mno-movcc
Do or don’t produce branchless conditional-move code sequences even with
targets that do not have specific instructions for conditional operations.
If enabled, sequences of ALU operations are produced using base integer
ISA instructions where profitable.
-minline-atomics ¶
-mno-inline-atomics
Do or don’t use smaller but slower subword atomic emulation code that uses
libatomic function calls.
The default is to use fast inline subword atomics
that do not require libatomic.
-minline-strlen ¶
-mno-inline-strlen
Do or do not attempt to inline strlen calls if possible.
Inlining will only be done if the string is properly aligned
and instructions for accelerated processing are available.
The default is to not inline strlen calls.
-minline-strcmp ¶
-mno-inline-strcmp
Do or do not attempt to inline strcmp calls if possible.
Inlining will only be done if the strings are properly aligned
and instructions for accelerated processing are available.
The default is to not inline strcmp calls.
The --param riscv-strcmp-inline-limit=n parameter controls
the maximum number of bytes compared by the inlined code.
The default value is 64.
-minline-strncmp ¶
-mno-inline-strncmp
Do or do not attempt to inline strncmp calls if possible.
Inlining will only be done if the strings are properly aligned
and instructions for accelerated processing are available.
The default is to not inline strncmp calls.
The --param riscv-strcmp-inline-limit=n parameter controls
the maximum number of bytes compared by the inlined code.
The default value is 64.
-mshorten-memrefs ¶
-mno-shorten-memrefs
Do or do not attempt to make more use of compressed load/store instructions by
replacing a load/store of ’base register + large offset’ with a new load/store
of ’new base + small offset’.
If the new base gets stored in a compressed
register, then the new load/store can be compressed.
Currently targets 32-bit
integer load/stores only.
-mstrict-align ¶
-mno-strict-align
Do not or do generate unaligned memory accesses.
The default is set depending
on whether the processor we are optimizing for supports fast unaligned access
or not.
-mscalar-strict-align ¶
-mno-scalar-strict-align
Do not or do generate unaligned memory accesses.
The default is set depending
on whether the processor we are optimizing for supports fast unaligned access
or not.
This is an alias for -mstrict-align.
-mvector-strict-align ¶
-mno-vector-strict-align
Do not or do generate unaligned vector memory accesses.
The default is set
to off unless the processor we are optimizing for explicitly supports
element-misaligned vector memory access.
-mcmodel=medlow ¶
Generate code for the medium-low code model. The program and its statically
defined symbols must lie within a single 2 GiB address range and must lie
between absolute addresses −2 GiB and +2 GiB. Programs can be statically
or dynamically linked. This is the default code model unless GCC has been
configured with --with-cmodel= specifying a different default code
model.
-mcmodel=medany ¶
Generate code for the medium-any code model. The program and its statically
defined symbols must be within any single 2 GiB address range. Programs can be
statically or dynamically linked.
The code generated by the medium-any code model is position-independent, but is
not guaranteed to function correctly when linked into position-independent
executables or libraries.
-mcmodel=large ¶
Generate code for a large code model, which has no restrictions on size or
placement of symbols.
-mexplicit-relocs
-mno-exlicit-relocs
Use or do not use assembler relocation operators when dealing with symbolic
addresses.
The alternative is to use assembler macros instead, which may
limit optimization.
-mrelax ¶
-mno-relax
Take advantage of linker relaxations to reduce the number of instructions
required to materialize symbol addresses. The default is to take advantage of
linker relaxations.
-mriscv-attribute ¶
-mno-riscv-attribute
Emit (do not emit) RISC-V attribute to record extra information into ELF
objects.
This feature requires at least binutils 2.32.
-mcsr-check ¶
-mno-csr-check
Enables or disables the CSR checking.
-malign-data=type ¶
Control how GCC aligns variables and constants of array, structure, or union
types.
Supported values for type are ‘xlen’ which uses x register
width as the alignment value, and ‘natural’ which uses natural alignment.
‘xlen’ is the default.
-mbig-endian ¶
Generate big-endian code.
This is the default when GCC is configured for a
‘riscv64be-*-*’ or ‘riscv32be-*-*’ target.
-mlittle-endian ¶
Generate little-endian code.
This is the default when GCC is configured for a
‘riscv64-*-*’ or ‘riscv32-*-*’ but not a ‘riscv64be-*-*’ or
‘riscv32be-*-*’ target.
-mstack-protector-guard=guard ¶
-mstack-protector-guard-reg=reg
-mstack-protector-guard-offset=offset
Generate stack protection code using canary at guard.
Supported
locations are ‘global’ for a global canary or ‘tls’ for per-thread
canary in the TLS block.
With the latter choice the options
-mstack-protector-guard-reg=reg and
-mstack-protector-guard-offset=offset furthermore specify
which register to use as base register for reading the canary,
and from what offset from that base register. There is no default
register or offset as this is entirely for use within the Linux
kernel.
-mtls-dialect=desc ¶
Use TLS descriptors as the thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses
of TLS variables.
-mtls-dialect=trad ¶
Use traditional TLS as the thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses
of TLS variables.
This is the default.
