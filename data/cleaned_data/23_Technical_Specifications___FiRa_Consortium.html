Technical Specifications Technical Specifications
As a first step to ensure compatibility across chipsets, devices and services infrastructures, FiRa has released a number of technical specifications including:FiRa Consortium UWB PHY Technical RequirementsThe FiRa Consortium UWB PHY Technical Requirements is used as the foundation for other specifications and the certification being driven by FiRa. This specification provides FiRa members with an overview of the UWB ranging technology that has been developed and provides guidance to developers who are actively working to develop new products based on UWB technology.FiRa Consortium UWB MAC Technical RequirementsThe FiRa Consortium UWB MAC Technical Requirements prescribes UWB ranging protocols and behavior of the ranging devices. Additionally, this specification defines elements such as how ranging protocol works, types of ranging that are supported, the parameters and format of the messages that are exchanged, and how ranging messages are encrypted.The IEEE defines the MAC and PHY lower protocol layers which are then used by the FiRa Consortium to develop profiles on top of the IEEE defined protocol layers.In addition to the released specifications, FiRa is preparing a Common Service Management Layer (CSML) specification. This is a critical specification that enables interoperability among FiRa devices and provides the framework and components needed for deploying service applications.The Technical Specification documents are available to all FiRa members. To access these documents, become part of the FiRa Certified ecosystem by joining FiRa.
