5 IEEE 802.15.4z-2020 UWB StandardThe IEEE 802.15.4z-2020 UWB standard is an amendment to IEEE Standard 802.15.4-2020 and
defines two profiles, High-Rate-Pulse (HRP) and Low-Rate-Pulse (LRP) for UWB
communication and ranging. The following table lists the LRP modes defined in the
amendment and the subset of these modes, which are comparable to the system modes of the
ATA8352 device for the verifier and prover modes, data communication and TDoA.Table 5-1. IEEE802.15.4z-2020 LRP and ATA8352 System ModesIEEE802.15.4z Operating ModesData RateModulationPRF [MHz]PPS

Note:
These
modes are mandatory modes defined in the IEEE 802.15.4z
amendment; the other modes are optional.These
modes are not defined in the IEEE 802.15.4z standard and
are proprietary for the ATA8352 device.
The modes implemented in the ATA8352 device have some deviations to the definitions in
the amendment, meaning, for the preamble and the synchronization, but are comparable for
data rate, modulation, PRF and PPS.
